# Capston-Project
Chatbots are really helpful these days. Together with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning chatbots can interact with humans like how we interact with each other. The implementation of chatbots is very useful especially in business when it comes to customer support. For the Capstone project I will be building an efficient AI Chatbot from scratch using deep learning Neural networks.

## The concept of an AI Chatbot
The Chatbot works based on DNN(Deep Neural Network) to identify the patterns of sentences given by the user as input and pick a random response related to that query. The NLTK Library in Python has functions that help to figure out the most relevant words from a sentence or paragraph and stem the words into their root meaning and can reduce them,(for instance, the root meaning or stem of the word 'going' is 'go'). This process is known as Stemming. The words are then converted into their corresponding numerical values since the Neural Networks only understand numbers. The process of converting text into numerical values is known as One-Hot Encoding. When the data preprocessing is completed we'll create Neural Networks using 'TFlearn' and then fit the training data into it. After the successful training, the model is able to predict the tags that are related to the user's query.
